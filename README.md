# marp-themes
Custom themes for [Marp Next](https://github.com/marp-team/marp).


## Simple theme
This theme is based on the official Gaia theme. I changed the slide size to 4:3, 
and use the solarized-dark color scheme for the code block.

This is just changed the slide size to 4:3 of the official Uncover theme.
