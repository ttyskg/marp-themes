# marp-themes

Custom themes for [Marp Next](https://github.com/marp-team/marp).

## Simple theme

This theme is based on the official Gaia theme. I changed the slide size to 4:3,
and use the solarized-dark color scheme for the code block.

This is just changed the slide size to 4:3 of the official Uncover theme.

## Uranus theme

A theme based on the official Gaia:

- changed the background color to white.
- most of the content is centered (figure, table, code block, etc).
- A SVG image as object element can be inserted.
  - To use this function, you should enable 'html1 option of marp.
